# azraoykulukan-binarySearchEx
It is desired to design a program that performs binary searches in a disk file containing names in line order. The file name and keyword will be read from the keyboard and the search will be performed according to the binary search algorithm. During the search process, only the necessary names will be read from the file and some names will be skipped when necessary. For this purpose, fseek(), one of the file functions, can be used. The names will be written line by line in the file, there is a name in each line. Design a relevant  program and measure the search time by testing it on a file with at least 100 names.
